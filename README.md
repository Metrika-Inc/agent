# Metrika Agent
[![CI Tests](https://github.com/Metrika-Inc/agent/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Metrika-Inc/agent/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Metrika Agent is a configurable software that regularly collects metrics and events from the host system and the blockchain node running on it. This data is then exported to one or more external sources via an [Exporter API](#exporter-api). By default the Metrika Agent sends data to the Metrika Platform for Blockchain Operational Intelligence.

## Installation
The Metrika Agent is intended to be installed with a one-line command from the Metrika Platform that downloads and runs the [Installation Script](install.sh):
```bash
MA_BLOCKCHAIN={blockchain} MA_API_KEY={api_key} bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Metrika-Inc/agent/master/install.sh)"
```
The script serves as installer by default, but can also be used with flags `--upgrade` or `--uninstall`. In its default mode it does the following:
* Determines the latest version published on Github and downloads its binary for `{blockchain}`.
* Creates a the `metrikad` user and group on the system,
* Sets up Metrika Agent as a `systemd` service.
* Creates and populates `/etc/metrikad`:
  * [agent.yml](configs/agent.yml) - agent's main configuration file. API key inserted from environment variable `MA_API_KEY`.
  * `{blockchain}.yml` - blockchain node specific configuration file. Rendered from .template files under [configs](configs/).
* Creates and populates `/opt/metrikad` with the Metrika Agent binary.
* Starts Metrika Agent service.

The agent can run as a standalone binary, as long as configuration files are set up correctly.

### Supported Blockchains
This is the list of all currently supported blockchains (several coming soon and we welcome contributions!):
* [flow](https://flow.com/)

## Configuration
The agent's configuration is set to sane defaults out of the box - in most use cases tinkering the configuration is unnecessary. 

Customization is possible by modifying the [agent.yml](configs/agent.yml) found in `/etc/metrikad/configs/agent.yml` after the installation.

### Parameter details
This covers a subset of configuration options that are most likely to be changed:
* `platform.api_key` - configured during install, an API key used for communicating with Metrika Platform. It maps the agent with your account.
* `buffer.max_heap_alloc` - maximum allowed allocations in heap (in bytes). Acts as a limit to prevent unlimited buffering. Default: `50MB`.
* `runtime.logging.outputs` - where Metrika outputs logs, can specify multiple sources. Default: `stdout` (journalctl). **Warning**: Metrika Agent does not take care of rotating the logs.
* `runtime.logging.level` - verbosity of the logs. Default - `warning`. Recommended to increase to `debug` when troubleshooting.
* `runtime.use_exporters` **(work in progress)* - enable other exporters. More on this in [Exporter API](#exporter-api). Default: `false`.
* `runtime.watchers` - list of enabled watchers (collectors). More on this in [Watchers](#watchers).
## Agent internals
### Watchers
A watcher is responsible for collecting metrics or events from a single source at regular intervals. Watchers are composable - a watcher can collect data from another watcher to do additional transformations on data.

By default, Metrika Agent starts watchers for system metrics and a subset of blockchain-specific metrics and events.
### Exporter API

_Be advised that the Exporter API is work in progress and may change without notice._

All the data points collected by the enabled watchers are passed to one or more exporters, as defined by the `Exporter` interface in [exporter_registry.go](internal/pkg/global/exporter_registry.go).

By default, the only enabled exporter is Metrika Platform exporter, which encodes the data as protocol buffers ([proto definition](api/v1/proto/agent.proto)) and transmits them to Metrika Platform. 

More on exporter implementations can be found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#implementing-exporters)
## Troubleshooting

### Logs
Agent issues can be troubleshot with the help of logs. By default agent logs can be accessed via:
```bash
journalctl -u metrikad-{blockchain}.service
```

### Blockchain Node Discovery Issues
The Metrika Agent attempts to discover a supported running blockchain node in the system. In case the blockchain node is containerized, Agent attempts to find the container by matching container name or image to a list of regular expressions specified in `/etc/metrikad/configs/{blockchain}.yml`. If the container name is not in the list of common names Metrika Agent is aware of, it can be added to the list of `containerRegex` in the aforementioned configuration file.

Please note that for containerized blockchain nodes, the agent needs to either:
1. Be added to the `docker` group OR
1. a suitable docker proxy needs to run on the host enabling partial access to the Docker API, and the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable needs to be correctly set to point to said proxy, in order to allow the Metrika Agent to retrieve blockchain node log and configuration files.

### Other issues
For issues pertaining to the agent itself, feel free to open up an Issue here on Github and we will try and help you reach a resolution. If you are experiencing issues with the Metrika Platform please use [this form](https://metrika.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/1/create/19).
